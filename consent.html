                    <b>About this consent form</b>
					<p/>
					<p>
					Please read this form carefully.  It tells you important information about a research study.  A member of our 					research team will also talk to you about taking part in this research study.  People who agree to take part in research 					studies are called “subjects.”  This term will be used throughout this consent form.Partners HealthCare System is made 					up of Partners hospitals, health care providers, and researchers.  In the rest of this consent form, we refer to the 					Partners system simply as “Partners.” If you have any questions about the research or about this form, please ask us.  					Taking part in this research study is up to you.  If you decide to take part in this research study, you must sign this 					form to show that you want to take part.  We will give you a signed copy of this form to keep.
					</p>
                    <p>
					<b>Why is this research study being done?</b>
					<p/>
					<p>
					The goal of this project is to test a task commonly conducted in lab settings on an online platform in order to 					better design future studies. We are asking you to take part in this research study because you indicated that you 					are over the age of 18 and live in the United States. About 40 people will take part in this research study.
					</p>
					<p>
					<b>How long will I take part in this research study?</b>
					</p>
					<p>
					This study involves a single session and should take between 40 minutes to an hour.
					</p>
					<p>
					b>What will happen in this research study?</b>
					</p>
					<p>
					If you agree to participate, we will ask you to complete one computerized task that involves remembering and 					forgetting given words. After you have completed the task, you will be provided with a participant ID and link to a 					survey platform. Here, you will fill out three surveys asking about thinking styles and a brief demographic survey.
					Early withdrawal: If you agree to participate in the study, you can stop at any time. There are no penalties for 					stopping early.
					</p>
					<p>
					<b>What are the risks and possible discomforts from being in this research study?</b>
					</p>
					<p>
					<u>Questionnaires:</u> You might feel uncomfortable while answering persona lquestions on the questionnaires. We 					ill not be collecting any information that can tie this information back to you. If you feel uncomfortable, you may stop 					the study
					</p>
					<p>
					<u>Confidentiality:</u> We will assign you a code number to protect your privacy, and all the information collected 					in this study will be labeled with this number. That means that your name will not be on any questionnaires or 					forms. Finally, all the information that we collect from you will be stored on password-protected computers. Only 					members of the research team will have access to this information. NOTE: The personal health information section of this consent form does not apply to the present study. No identifying information will be collected from you.
					</p>
					<p>
					<u>Data Sharing:</u> We do not have any plans to share the data collected in this study.
					</p>
					<p>
					<b>What are the possible beneifts from being in this research study?</b>
					</p>
					<p>
					You will not benefit directly from this study. However, the information we gain from this work will be used to design a follow-up study that will investigate the relationship between rumination, worry, and emotional memory in depressed and anxious adults.
					</p>
					<p>
					<b>Can I still get medical care within Partners if I don't take part in this research study, or if I stop taking part?</b>
					</p>
					<p>
					Yes.  Your decision won’t change the medical care you get within Partners now or in the future.  There will be no penalty, and you won’t lose any benefits you receive now or have a right to receive.
					</p>
					<p>
					Taking part in this research study is up to you.  You can decide not to take part.  If you decide to take part now, you can change your mind and drop out later.  We will tell you if we learn new information that could make you change your mind about taking part in this research study.
					</p>
					<p>
					<b>What should I do if I want to stop taking part in the study?</b>
					</p>
					<p>
					If you take part in this research study, and want to drop out, you should tell us. We will make sure that you stop the study safely. We will also talk to you about follow-up care, if needed. Also, it is possible that we will have to ask you to drop out of the study before you finish it. If this happens, we will tell you why. We will also help arrange other care for you, if needed. 
					</p>
					<p>
					<b>Will I be paid to take part in this research study?</b>
					</p>
					<p>
					Yes. You will be paid $2.50 upon completion of the entire study.
					</p>
					<p>
					<b>What happens if I am injured as a result of taking part in this research study?</b>
					</p>
					<p>
					While we do not expect any injuries will occur from this online study, if you are injured as a direct result of taking part in this research study, we will assist you in obtaining the medical care needed to treat the injury. This means arranging for (but not paying for) transportation to an acute care center for treatment of the injury.  McLean Hospital is a psychiatric care facility and does not provide general health care services.
					</p>
					<p>
					The care provider may bill your insurance company or other third parties, if appropriate, for the care you get for the injury.  We will try to have these costs paid for, but you may be responsible for some of them.  For example, if the care is billed to your insurer, you will be responsible for payment of any deductibles and co-payments required by your insurer.</p><p>Injuries sometimes happen in research even when no one is at fault.  There are no plans to pay you or give you other compensation for an injury, should one occur.  However, you are not giving up any of your legal rights by signing this form.
					</p>

The sponsor has agreed that it will not contact you without your permission and will not use or share your information for any mailing or marketing list.  However, once your information is shared outside Partners, we cannot control all the ways that others use or share it and cannot promise that it will remain private.
